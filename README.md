# Autonomous_WMR
This repository contains a basic system to control a ground autonomous vehicle.

The code has been written using Python and using ROS Kinetic. It still needs some work and it's still in an early phase. To get any simulation using done using Gazebo or any of the arduino codes that we have written, please reach out to me on my LinkedIn. You can find the link on my profile.
